Time Series Forecasting (Advanced), Anomaly Detection & ML Optimization 

1️⃣ Time Series Components (Advanced Breakdown) 
==================================================
Summary: 
Deep dive into trend, seasonality, cyclic patterns, and residual noise. Learn decomposition techniques for better forecasting. Example: Decomposing monthly sales using STL into separate components.

2️⃣ Stationarity & Differencing (ADF Test) 
==============================================
Summary: 
Why forecasting models require stationarity & how differencing fixes non-stationarity. Example: Applying ADF test → p-value < 0.05 → series is stationary.

 3️⃣ ARIMA & SARIMA Hyperparameter Tuning
=================================================
 Summary: 
Choosing p, d, q values; using AIC/BIC score for better model selection. Example: Grid search for SARIMA(1,1,1)(1,0,1,12) for monthly dataset. Video: “ARIMA & SARIMA Hyperparameter Tuning – Complete Guide” 


4️⃣ Prophet Forecasting (Advanced)
========================================
 Summary:
